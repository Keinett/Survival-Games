#Configuration for the chest item ratios
#this system works by levels. Level 1 aka lvl1 
#is the most common stuff whereas lvl5 is the least 
#common. You can set what will spawn at each level below.
#The ratio setting determines how likley the next level is
#to spawn in. a ratio of 2 means that it is twice as unlikley
#for the next level to spawn in.
##FORMAT
# <itemid>,<max amount per slot>
