Survival Games (Fork maintained by Pocketkid2)
==============================================
I have been a fan of the original SurvivalGames plugin. I decided to fork it because the original developer has been inactive for about 2 years. I will be maintaining this plugin to the best of my ability. I will document what I can, remove old code, finish new features, and I will look at any issue you put in this repo's tracker. Documentation will be on the wiki in the future. Releases will also appear here. Basically, if you care about the plugin, you should bookmark/star this repo and watch for updates.

Development status: Testing
---------------------------
I've just started working on this, but won't be able to perfectly test everything because I don't have a big server and whatnot. If you use this plugin and would like to help report bugs please do so by using the github releases build.

Development builds: CircleCI
----------------------------
Go [here](https://circleci.com/gh/Pocketkid2/Survival-Games), click on the latest successful build, and click on the artifacts tab. There you will find the SurvivalGames.jar
