Update: (6/14/16 - Rushnett)
------------------
Going to fork this project for a server I run since Pocketkid2 has decided to stop maintaining his version. Edits will be made by Keiaxx and myself. From Pocketkid2's last working version, the tested MC versions are spigot 1.8.8 - 1.9.4 (though 1.9.4 is not fully supported). Still a lot of bug fixing to do so this should still be considered pre release.
