Survival Games (Fork maintained by Pocketkid2)
==============================================
I have been a fan of the original SurvivalGames plugin. I decided to fork it because the original developer has been inactive for about 2 years. I will be maintaining this plugin to the best of my ability. I will document what I can, remove old code, finish new features, and I will look at any issue you put in this repo's tracker. Documentation will be on the wiki in the future. Releases will also appear here. Basically, if you care about the plugin, you should bookmark/star this repo and watch for updates.

Development status: Accepting Work
---------------------------
I need suggestions on what parts to focus on. Put them in the issue tracker and I will label them as enhancements. As always, bugs of any sort should be reported with any info possible.
