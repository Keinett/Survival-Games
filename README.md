Survival Games (KN Edition)
=================================
This is an extensive rework of Double_0_negative's Survival Games plugin for Spigot and Bukkit 1.8+, using Pocketkid2's updated fork. This rework (SGKNE), is maintained by Rushnett and Keiaxx and is designed for the mc network we own called [Keinett](http://keinett.com), but works fully as a drag and drop plugin. Later along development, we plan to release this plugin so that others may be able to use it with extensive documentation for help, as well as continuous updates. The original page of this plugin is located [here](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/survival-games/), and most of the core systems (like creating arenas) is still the same.
